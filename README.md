## Description
Somatic-shortV-nf is a pipeline for identifying somatic short variant (SNPs and indels) events in human Illumina short read whole genome sequence data from tumour and matched normal BAM files. The pipeline follows the [GATK's Best Practices](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035894731-Somatic-short-variant-discovery-SNVs-Indels-) workflow. 
The pipeline is written in Nextflow and uses Singularity/Docker to run containerised tools.

There are two main steps to this workflow 
1. Generate a large set of candidate somatic variants using the tool [Mutect2](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531132). 
2. Filter the candidate variants to obtain a more confident set of somatic variant calls.

## User guide 

To run this pipeline, you will need to prepare your input files, reference data, and clone this repository. Before proceeding, ensure Nextflow is installed on the system you're working on. To install Nextflow, see these [instructions](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation). 

### 1. Prepare inputs

To run this pipeline you will need the following inputs: 

* Paired Tumor-Normal (T-N) paired BAM files
* Corresponding BAM index files  
* Input sample sheet 

This pipeline processes paired BAM files and is capable of processing multiple samples in parallel. BAM files are expected to be coordinate sorted and indexed (see [Fastq-to-BAM](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Fastq-to-BAM) for an example of a best practice workflow that can generate these files).  

You will need to create a sample sheet with information about the samples you are processing, before running the pipeline. This file must be **comma-separated** and contain a header and one row per sample. Columns should correspond to sampleID, BAM-N file-path, BAM-T file-path: 

```csv
sampleID,bam-N,bam-T 
SAMPLE1,/data/Bams/sample1-N.bam,/data/Bams/sample1-T.bam
SAMPLE2,/data/Bams/sample2-N.bam,/data/Bams/sample2-T.bam
``````

When you run the pipeline, you will use the mandatory `--input` parameter to specify the location and name of the input file: 

```
--input /path/to/samples.csv
```

### 2. Prepare the reference materials 

To run this pipeline you will need the following reference files:

- Indexed reference genome in FASTA format. 
  - Reference FASTA files must be accompanied by a .fai index file. 
  - You can download FASTA files from the [Ensembl](https://asia.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html), [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/ftp.html), or [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/doc/ftpfaq/) ftp sites. 

- You can use our [IndexReferenceFasta-nf pipeline](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/IndexReferenceFasta-nf) to generate indexes. 
This pipeline uses the following tools for generating specific index files.
  - [samtools](https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-faidx.html).fai
  - [picard](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037593331-CreateSequenceDictionary-Picard-).dict 
  - [bwa](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml).amb, .ann, .bwt, .pac, .sa 


***Note***: You must specify the full path for the reference fasta, even if it is in your working directory.


### 3. Download files
#### Download the sub-interval files required for Mutect2 
  - **Step 1**: Click on the [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/genomics-public-data/resources/broad/hg38/v0;tab=objects?pli=1&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false&pageState=(%22StorageObjectListTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%255D%22)))
  - **Step 2**: Click on [scattered_calling_intervals] and select all checkboxes and click `Download`. 
  - **Step 3**: To download all the files, you will need to install the utility `gsutil`. Please follow the steps as shown below in a command-line window
    - Download, unzip and install the excecutable  
      - curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-cli-457.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
      - tar -xf google-cloud-cli-457.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
      - ./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
      - Close rhe current command-line window and re-open it. The utility `gsutil` will now be available in the path.
  - **Step 4**:Go back to Step (2) and download the files as suggested.

#### A Panel of Normals (PoN) for Mutect2  
The user can create a PoN file using our [pipeline](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Somatic-ShortV?tab=readme-ov-file#4-create-pon-per-genomic-interval).

#### Common biallelic variant resources for GetPileupSummaries 
The user can create the Common biallelic variant resource files using our [pipeline](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Somatic-ShortV?tab=readme-ov-file#0-optional-create-common-biallelic-variant-resources)

### 4. Clone this repository 

Download the code contained in this repository with: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Somatic-shortV-nf
```

This will create a directory with the following structure: 
```
Somatic-shortV-nf/
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── config/
├── images/
├── scripts/
├── main.nf
├── modules/
└── nextflow.config
```
The important features are: 

* **main.nf** contains the main nextflow script that calls all the processes in the workflow.
* **nextflow.config** contains default parameters to use in the pipeline.
* **modules** contains individual process files for each step in the workflow. 
* **config** contains infrastructure-specific config files (this is currently under development)

### 4. Run the pipeline 

The most basic run command for this pipeline is: 

```
nextflow run main.nf --input samples.csv --ref reference.fasta  --intervalList_path path_to_intervals --ponvcf pon.vcf.gz
        
```
**Note**: Please use the command provided in the script `scripts/run_pipeline_on_gadi_script.sh` on NCI Gadi HPC.

By default, this will generate `work` directory, `results` output directory and a `runInfo` run metrics directory inside the results directory. 

To specify additional optional tool-specific parameters, see what flags are supported by running:

```
nextflow run main.nf --help 
```

If for any reason your workflow fails, you are able to resume the workflow from the last successful process with `-resume`. 


### NCI Gadi HPC

Before running the pipeline you will need to load Nextflow and Singularity, both of which are globally installed modules on Gadi. You can do this by running the commands below:

```
module purge
module load nextflow singularity
```

To run this workflow on NCI Gadi HPC, you can excecute the script `scripts/run_pipeline_on_gadi_script.sh` by first entering the following details in the PBS header of the script:
- project code
- Resource-related details  
  - walltime
  - ncpus
  - mem

You can then submit the script using the command:  
```
qsub runPipeline_script.sh
```
**Note**
- The main script is excecuted using the queue `copyq` so that the singularity container images required by the pipeline are downloaded.
- The NCI Gadi config currently runs all tasks on the normal queue. This config uses the `--gadi-account` flag to assign a project code to all task job submissions for billing purposes. The version of Nextflow installed on Gadi has been modified to make it easier to specify resource options for jobs submitted to the cluster. See NCI's [Gadi user guide](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/DAE/Nextflow) for more details.


### 5. Results 
Once the pipeline is complete, you will find all outputs for each sample in the `results` directory. 

## Infrastructure usage and recommendations
This pipeline has been successfully implemented on [NCI Gadi](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems) using infrastructure-specific config. This config can be used to interact with the job scheduler and assign a project code to all task job submissions for billing purposes. You can use the following flags to handle accounting:

* `--gadi-account` the Gadi project account you would like to bill service units to

## Help / FAQ / Troubleshooting
* It is essential that the reference genome you're using contains the same chromosomes, contigs, and scaffolds as the BAM files. To confirm what contigs are included in your indexed BAM file, you can use Samtools idxstats:
```
samtools idxstats input.bam | cut -f 1
```
